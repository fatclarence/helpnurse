# Okta Identity Early Access Hackathon 2021

## What

This React application is made within the context of the Okta Identity Early Access Hackathon 2021. The goal is to explore the new possibilities of the Okta Identity Engine.

The main purpose of this application is to provide a platform for nurses to effectively create, retrieve, update, delete discharge summaries of patients. The process is currently manual and thus, having an app would greatly improve this experience.

### Used technologies

React, MongoDB, Express, Node

#### Okta

All login-related tasks are handled with ease by [Okta](https://www.okta.com/). Okta provides secure, scalable, and highly available authentication and user management for any app.
